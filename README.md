These are my solutions to [Advent of Code.](https://adventofcode.com/)

I'm currently using this as a means to learn Rust. As a result, these solutions are especially messy. I plan to go back and refactor/clean up/optimize these over time to make them more Rust-like/idiomatic and use less clunky solutions.
